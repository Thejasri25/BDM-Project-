Distribution of Item Count:
The distribution of item counts in our online sales data provides valuable insights into the purchasing behaviour of customers at our restaurant. This analysis focuses on understanding the frequency of orders that include a certain number of items. By examining this distribution, we gain a clear understanding of whether customers tend to order a specific number of items more frequently. Through this analysis, we can identify the most common order sizes and any potential trends. For instance, we might find that single-item orders are the most prevalent, indicating that customers prefer to place simpler orders. On the other hand, a higher frequency of larger order sizes could imply that customers often opt for bundled or combo deals.
By visualizing this distribution, we can pinpoint any anomalies or outliers in the data. This could lead us to discover special events or promotions that drove larger orders during specific time periods.
Figure 1:Histogram- Distribution of Item Count

Key Insights:
Overall, understanding the distribution of item counts enhances our understanding of customer preferences, informs inventory management decisions, and helps tailor marketing strategies to cater to different order sizes. The majority of orders consist of a small number of items, with counts of 1 and 2 being the most frequent. This could indicate that customers often order one or two items per order, which might suggest a trend toward quick, individualized purchases.. The distribution suggests that the range of item counts in each order remains relatively consistent, with a gradual decrease as the count increases. This indicates that customers are accustomed to ordering a certain number of items per order and deviate less frequently from that pattern.This strategy could streamline the ordering process for customers and potentially increase sales. It's possible that customers are more inclined to order individual or small quantities of items rather than larger combinations.
2. Distribution of Bill Amount:
The distribution analysis of bill amounts within our online sales data offers valuable insights into the spending patterns of customers at our restaurant. This examination focuses on understanding the frequency of various bill amounts across all orders. Through this analysis, we can identify common bill amounts and potential trends in customer spending behavior. This information is crucial for setting pricing strategies, as well as for evaluating the popularity of certain menu items based on their contribution to overall bill amounts. Visualizing the distribution of bill amounts can also help us identify any outliers or anomalies in the data.
This might lead us to discover high-value orders that correspond to special occasions, events, or promotions. It could also reveal instances of customers availing of discounts, bundles, or combo deals that affect the final bill amount. By harnessing the insights from this analysis, we can make informed decisions about menu pricing, promotions, and customer engagement strategies.

Figure 2:Histogram- Distribution of Bill Amounts
Key Insights:
The interval of Rs.150 to Rs.200 seems to be the most popular price range, with around 130 orders falling within this range. This indicates that many customers are willing to spend within this specific range for their orders. The distribution shows several smaller peaks, such as around Rs.150-175, Rs.200-225, and Rs.225-250. These peaks might correspond to specific pricing tiers or menu items that attract customers.
The distribution follows a generally decreasing pattern as the bill amount increases. This suggests that higher-priced orders are less frequent, which is expected as customers might be more selective when spending larger amounts. The distribution's shape indicates that the restaurant caters to a diverse customer base with varying spending habits. Some customers prefer lower-priced options, while others are willing to spend more for specific items.
3. Distribution of Monthly sales:
The examination of the distribution of monthly sales within our online sales data provides a comprehensive overview of the revenue generated by our restaurant across different months. This analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and variations in sales performance over time, offering critical insights into the business's overall health and

customer behaviour. Visualizing the distribution of monthly sales enables us to grasp the larger trends that shape our restaurant's revenue streams.
It can highlight the impact of marketing campaigns, promotions, and special events on sales performance, helping us refine strategies to optimize revenue generation. Moreover, this analysis provides a broader context for decision-making regarding resource allocation, inventory management, and staffing requirements. Identifying anomalies or sudden spikes in monthly sales can uncover hidden opportunities or challenges.
It might indicate unexpected factors like customer preferences shifting towards certain items or an increased adoption of online ordering during specific months. By leveraging the insights gained from analyzing the distribution of monthly sales, we can enhance our forecasting accuracy, capitalize on trends, and proactively address potential revenue fluctuations.
Figure 3 Distribution of Monthy Sales
Key Insights:
The sales figures for April, May, and June indicate a noticeable seasonal variation. The highest sales are observed in April, followed by June, and then May. This could be

indicative of certain factors influencing customer behavior during these months. April stands out as the month with the highest total sales, exceeding Rs. 1,30,000.
When I personally questioned the owner the reason for the variation and decrease in sale for the month of April, he informed me that the restaurant is near a hospital and a good amount of customers of the restaurant are patients who visit the hospital. The hospital started its new branch near the city and shifted some of the department to the new branch, hence the number of customers who visits this restaurant has decreased during the months of May and June, Hence, the variation in sales is observed.
4. Distribution of Weekly sales:
The exploration of the distribution of weekly sales within our online sales data offers a valuable perspective on the restaurant's revenue trends over shorter time frames. By examining the distribution of weekly sales, we gain a granular understanding of how the restaurant's revenue varies from week to week. This analysis helps to identify weeks with consistently high sales, potentially indicating regular customer engagement or specific promotions that drive increased orders.
Conversely, weeks with lower sales can offer insights into factors such as external events, holidays, or less active periods. Visualizing the distribution of weekly sales allows us to capture more immediate trends that might not be apparent when looking at monthly or yearly data. Peaks and troughs in weekly sales can help us understand the impact of weekly specials, marketing campaigns, or changes in consumer behaviour.
Analyzing the distribution of weekly sales also enables us to assess the effectiveness of time-sensitive initiatives. For instance, if we introduce a new menu item or promotional offer, we can monitor the immediate response in terms of weekly sales to gauge its popularity and success.
The insights gleaned from the analysis of weekly sales distribution can play a pivotal role in refining inventory management strategies, optimizing staffing levels, and planning marketing efforts with a shorter-term focus. By leveraging this analysis, we

enhance our ability to make informed decisions that lead to increased revenue, improved customer satisfaction, and the overall success of the restaurant.
Figure 4 Distribution of Weekly Sales
Key Insights:
The mention of the first week of April being shorter due to the dataset's starting date demonstrates an awareness of the dataset's limitations and a thorough analysis approach. The observation of sales upticks during the second and third weeks of April and May, followed by declines in the subsequent weeks, indicates a cyclic pattern. This could be due to factor like payday cycles. The consistent pattern of a rise in sales during the second and third weeks of each month suggests that these weeks might have favourable conditions for consumer spending, such as weekends, holidays, or special events. The noticeable drop in sales during the final week of both April and May could be attributed to the end-of-month dynamics, where customers might be more cautious with their spending after the initial surge earlier in the month.
5. Unveiling Peak Hourly Sales Patterns:
The exploration of the peak hourly sales pattern in our online sales data reveals critical insights into the timing of customer orders and provides valuable information for optimizing business operations and enhancing customer experience. By unveiling

the peak hourly sales pattern, we gain a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and preferences.
It allows us to identify when customers are most likely to place orders, whether it's during lunch hours, dinner time, or even late-night cravings. This knowledge enables us to allocate resources effectively, ensuring that staffing levels, kitchen operations, and delivery logistics are optimized to handle increased demand during peak hours. The peak hourly sales pattern also influences strategic decision-making regarding promotions and marketing efforts.
For instance, if the analysis reveals that there is a consistent surge in orders during certain hours, we can design targeted promotions to attract more customers during slower periods. Additionally, understanding the peak hours helps us plan special offers or discounts during times when customer traffic naturally dips. Furthermore, this analysis aids in managing inventory and supplies efficiently.
Knowing the peak sales hours allows us to stock up on ingredients and supplies precisely when they are likely to be in high demand. This reduces the risk of shortages during crucial times and minimizes wastage during slower hours. Visualizing the peak hourly sales pattern helps in identifying trends over different days, weeks, and months.
This information is particularly valuable for identifying seasonal shifts in customer behavior. For example, we might observe variations in peak hours during weekends, holidays, or special occasions. Such insights allow us to adapt our strategies to align with customer preferences during these periods.
Moreover, understanding the peak hourly sales pattern provides insights into technology infrastructure requirements. If the online ordering platform experiences heavy traffic during specific hours, we can ensure that our systems are robust and capable of handling increased load without disruptions. In summary, unveiling the peak hourly sales pattern enhances our ability to streamline operations, improve customer service, and drive revenue growth. It empowers us to proactively respond to customer demands, plan promotions effectively, optimize staffing, manage inventory efficiently, and ensure a seamless online ordering experience.

Figure 5:Frequency of Hourly Orders
Key Insights:
The absence of orders between 0 to 5 hours indicates a period of low customer activity, is due to the early morning hours when most customers aren't placing orders. The slow and gradual rise in order count after 5 hours suggests that customers start placing orders as the morning progresses, but the pace is still relatively modest. The significant increase in order count after 10 hours indicates the beginning of a morning rush. This could coincide with breakfast or early lunch orders, suggesting that the restaurant's offerings are appealing to customers during this time. The order count reaching around 100 at 12 hours (noon) suggests a peak during the lunchtime rush. This is a crucial insight as it indicates that the restaurant's menu items are popular choices for lunch. The relatively stable order count from 12 to 15 hours suggests consistent customer activity during the early afternoon. The gradual increase in order count after 15 hours indicates a surge in the late afternoon to early evening. This is due to early dinner or snack orders. The order count rising to around 200 at 17 hours and remaining constant till 18 or 19 hours signifies a significant dinner rush. This period represents the busiest time for the restaurant. The gradual decrease in order count after 19 or 20 hours suggests a winding down of orders as the evening progresses.

6. Unveiling Peak Daily Sales Patterns:
The exploration of the daily hourly sales pattern in our online sales data offers valuable insights into the intricacies of customer behaviour throughout each day. By breaking down the data into hourly segments, we gain a clear understanding of the ebb and flow of customer demand, both during weekdays and weekends. This information aids in allocating resources effectively, ensuring that the restaurant is adequately staffed and equipped to handle fluctuations in order volumes throughout the day.
The daily hourly sales pattern analysis also reveals insights into meal preferences and timing. For example, we can observe if there is a surge in breakfast orders during the early hours, a peak in lunch orders around midday, and a trend towards dinner orders in the evening. This information helps in tailoring the menu offerings and promotions to cater to specific meal preferences at different times of the day.
Understanding the daily hourly sales pattern is pivotal for optimizing the kitchen's efficiency. With knowledge of the hours when order volumes are high, the kitchen can prepare and cook meals in advance, ensuring that orders are fulfilled promptly and minimizing customer wait times. Conversely, during slower hours, the kitchen can focus on tasks such as restocking and cleaning.
Moreover, this analysis guides marketing efforts by identifying strategic windows for promotions and special offers. By aligning promotions with hours when customer activity is relatively lower, we can incentivize orders during traditionally quieter periods, thus maximizing revenue potential. Visualizing the daily hourly sales pattern allows us to identify any cyclical trends that repeat across different days of the week.
This is particularly useful for spotting variations in customer behavior during weekdays versus weekends. These insights assist in creating tailored strategies for different days to ensure optimal customer satisfaction.
Furthermore, the analysis of the daily hourly sales pattern informs operational decisions, such as managing delivery logistics and online platform maintenance. It

helps us ensure that our delivery fleet is well-prepared to handle peak hours and that our online ordering system can accommodate heavy traffic without disruptions.
In summary, unveiling the daily hourly sales pattern enables us to enhance operational efficiency, improve customer experience, and drive revenue growth. By delving into the nuances of customer behavior at different times of the day, we can make informed decisions that enhance order processing, kitchen operations, marketing initiatives, and overall restaurant performance.
This analysis positions us to provide a seamless and satisfying online ordering experience to our valued customers.
Figure 6:Frequency of Daily orders
Key Insights:
The high order count of around 175 on Monday suggests a strong start to the week. This can be attributed to customers resuming their routine after the weekend and choosing the restaurant's offerings. The order counts of around 150 on Tuesday and Friday indicate relatively consistent midweek demand. The order count reaching around 160 on Wednesday could be indicative of a midweek surge in customer activity. The high order count of around 175 on Thursday suggests a significant peak in customer

demand. The order counts of around 230 on both Saturday and Sunday indicate substantial demand on weekends. This aligns with common patterns where people have more leisure time and are more likely to place food orders.
7. Apriori Algorithm:
In the context of the restaurant industry, one of the key challenges faced by establishments engaging in online sales is the impact of costs associated with online delivery partners and digital advertising. As part of a strategic approach to enhance profitability, I embarked on a solution that focused on optimizing advertising expenditures while concurrently offering customers a more tailored and satisfying dining experience.
The primary goal was to mitigate the financial strain arising from two significant sources: the commission imposed by online delivery partners and the expenses incurred in online advertising campaigns. These costs can considerably reduce the overall profit margin of the restaurant.
To address this challenge, I adopted a data-driven approach that involved the utilization of the Apriori algorithm, a popular technique for association rule mining and market basket analysis. The proposed solution involves harnessing the power of data analytics and machine learning to optimize advertisement spending also by providing customers with personalized recommendations for frequently bought together items. Association rule mining techniques, such as the Apriori algorithm, were applied to identify itemsets that were frequently bought together by customers.
Benefits:
• Customers received tailored recommendations, enhancing their overall experience and satisfaction. Encouraging customers to add complementary items to their orders led to larger transactions and increased revenue.
• As customers were prompted to explore additional products, the need for aggressive and costly advertising campaigns was diminished. By curbing advertising expenses and increasing order sizes, the restaurant's profitability was significantly improved.

The Apriori algorithm was employed to identify frequently bought items within the dataset. This algorithm utilizes association rule mining to determine items that are often purchased together by customers.
Frequently bought items:
Table 1 Support value found for Frequent items
Chicken Tikka Sandwich has the highest support value of 0.136, indicating that it is the most frequently purchased item among the analyzed transactions. French fries are another popular choice with a support value of 0.125. Customers often pair them with other items. The sweetcorn sandwich variant has a support value of 0.069, indicating a significant presence in customer orders.
Frequently bought together item sets:
The generated rules were evaluated based on metrics such as support, confidence, and lift. High-confidence rules indicated strong relationships between items in customer orders. These rules were then ranked to identify the most influential ones. The identified rules can be utilized to build a recommendation engine that will suggest complementary items to customers based on their selected products. This mechanism will encourage customers to explore additional options, leading to larger order sizes. By guiding customers towards purchasing items that were frequently bought together, the restaurant will be able to effectively cross-sell and upsell without relying heavily on costly advertising campaigns. This, in turn, will reduce advertising expenditure while increasing revenue.

Table 2 Frequently bought item sets
By leveraging the insights provided by association rule mining, the restaurant can craft a targeted recommendation system that not only will enhance customer experience but also drive revenue growth while optimizing profitability. This approach will represent a win-win situation for both customers and the restaurant, fostering a symbiotic relationship that will benefit all parties involved.
